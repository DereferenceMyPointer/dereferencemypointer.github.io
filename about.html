			<p>This site and all of its content is a collection of game development-oriented work done by Milo Gerhard, or as I will henceforth refer to him, me.</p>
			<p>
				I am currently a student in astronautical and aeronautical engineering at the University of Washington, and I am also minoring in physics.
				Neither of those seem to align very well with the purpose of this site, so allow me to explain.
			</p>
			<p>
				Majors at the University of Washington are competitive. This means that, if you aren't already in a major, actually receiving a useful degree
				is less than guaranteed. In some cases, it's nearly impossible.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I applied to the school, I wasn't totally sure what I wanted to do. So I listed two majors that sounded reasonably interesting to me.
				One was computer science, because I'd been exposed to programming from an early age and enjoyed doing it, and the other was an area of engineering
				completely unrelated to the one I'm in now.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I got in to the school, I was assigned engineering undeclared, the status given to people who are going to do engineering and were let in.
				What I didn't know until this point was that, aside from standard admission, it's nearly impossible to get into an engineering major.
			</p>
			<p>
				While I have no problem with doing aerospace engineering due to its extensibility to a lot of the things I enjoy and the relative job security
				such a degree provides, I'm using my own time to expand into fields I have more of a personal interest in. The reason I haven't decided to change degrees
				to one more obviously related to these interests is this difficulty of returning to my current major.
			</p>
			<p>
				My main choice of degree other than engineering is actually physics, which is probably obvious from the choice of minor. This is pretty easy to include into my
				curriculum because of the crossover between engineering and physics. I can't, however, work toward a double major in physics and engineering because they're actually
				separate degrees, which requires an extra year of coursework to do both.
			</p>
			<p>
				Long story short, because of the competition involved with majors at the UW, I'm stuck in programs less directly related to my actual career and personal interests
				than I would ideally be. But I am open to work of all kinds, whether game-, CS-, engineering-, or physics-related.
			</p>
			<p>
				All of the work on this site is my own and the site itself was created by me.
