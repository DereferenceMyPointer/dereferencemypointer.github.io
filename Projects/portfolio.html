                    An introductory deep learning project using the MNIST letters database and various
                    methods of analyzing and classifying the data using PyTorch. A brief report on my
                    observations is also available on the linked page along with the code.

                <p>
                    Created in two weeks for the UW Game Dev Club Winter Jam 2021, this project is a
                    2D top-down game with roguelike mechanics. It has dynamic soundtracking, a flexible
                    wave system, items that can be added to any character and interact via hit, kill, heal,
                    death, etc. The enemies also have state-based behaviors that are editor friendly.
                    I made the art, animations, and music in addition to architecting the game and writing
                    all of the code during the two week time period I had to make it.

                    Created in two days for the 2020 GMTK jam, this top-down 2D shooter uses
                    very unusual shooting mechanics to guide chaotic gameplay that matches
                    the theme "out of control." This project was a collaborative effort with
                    Eraser_Cat on itch.io, with the majority of programming being done by me
                    and the art and music asset work split roughly 50/50. The total work time
                    on the project was under 14 hours.

                <p>
                    This project is a cookie clicker-like game made entirely using DOM manipulation
                    in javascript (meaning the interactable game elements are all HTML DOM elements,
                    and their organization and movement occurs through CSS). Done for a University of
                    Washington introductory web development course.

                <p>
                    This project is a trading card maker that implements an API
                    call to find images to use. Also done for a University of
                    Washington introductory web development course.

                <p>
                    This project is a very simple plant generator that uses L-systems and 
                    recursive draw calls to generate plantlike structures</p>
