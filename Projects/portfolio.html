                <p>
                    A Godot 2D tool for procedural 2D map generation written in GDScript.
                    Uses a multi-step generation process to place progression and required objectives
                    within constraints such as order, progression direction, and width of progression area.
                    Currently only supports vertical progression directions and pure random generation.

                <p>
                    An introductory deep learning project using the MNIST letters database and various
                    methods of analyzing and classifying the data using PyTorch. A brief report on my
                    observations is also available on the linked page along with the code.

                <p>
                    Created in two weeks for the UW Game Dev Club Winter Jam 2021, this project is a
                    2D top-down game with roguelike mechanics. It has dynamic soundtracking, a flexible
                    wave system, items that can be added to any character and interact via hit, kill, heal,
                    death, etc. The enemies also have state-based behaviors that are editor friendly.
                    I made the art, animations, and music in addition to architecting the game and writing
                    all of the code during the two week time period I had to make it.

                <p>
                    Created in two days for the 2020 GMTK jam, this top-down 2D shooter uses
                    very unusual shooting mechanics to guide chaotic gameplay that matches
                    the theme "out of control." This project was a collaborative effort with
                    Eraser_Cat on itch.io, with the majority of programming being done by me
                    and the art and music asset work split roughly 50/50. The total work time
                    on the project was under 14 hours.

                <p>
                    This project is a cookie clicker-like game made entirely using DOM manipulation
                    in javascript (meaning the interactable game elements are all HTML DOM elements,
                    and their organization and movement occurs through CSS). Done for a University of
                    Washington introductory web development course.

                    This project is a trading card maker that implements an API
                    call to find images to use. Also done for a University of

                <p>
                    This project is a very simple plant generator that uses L-systems and 
                    recursive draw calls to generate plantlike structures.

                        but the project was discontinued

                        A brief investigation of a quantum mechanics paper in Python (done as a school project)
