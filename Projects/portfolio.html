                    This project is a very simple plant generator that uses L-systems and 
                    recursive draw calls to generate plantlike structures</p>

                <p>
                    This project is a cookie clicker-like game made entirely using DOM manipulation
                    in javascript (meaning the interactable game elements are all HTML DOM elements,
                    and their organization and movement occurs through CSS).

                    This project is a trading card maker that implements an API
                    call to find images to use.

                    This project contains some of the groundwork for a 3D game engine, using WebGL
                    through three.js. This project is currently on permament pause. Functionality
                    currently includes loading a model and playing an animation on demand, although
                    this does not work in all browsers. There is a game object system that is not
                    fully in use that handles models, animations, and behaviors, although the
                    hypothetical behaviors currently supported are limited to motion and playing
                    animations.
